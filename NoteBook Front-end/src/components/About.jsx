        <h1>About JP.NoteBook</h1>
        <p>
          Your interactive companion for mastering the Japanese language through
          text, drawing, and real-time translations. JP.NoteBook was created
          when I was about to start learning Japanese. I had an idea that would
          help people learn it, so I created this app to simplify and enhance
          the learning experience.
